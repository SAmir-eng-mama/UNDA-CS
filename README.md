## 🎯 Project Overview
This project analyses healthcare worker engagement and attrition data using a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI).  
It visualizes employee patterns such as department distribution, marital status, and attrition rate to support workforce analysis.

The dataset used in this project is named **`nurs.csv`**, containing 500 artificial employee records with fields such as age, gender, department, hourly rate, work-life balance, and attrition.

## 🧠 Features
- Load and process data from **nurs.csv** using **Pandas**
- Display key statistics including:
  - Total number of employees  
  - Departments and their employee counts  
  - Gender distribution  
  - Min, max, and average for age, hourly rate, and distance from home  
  - Marital status percentages  
  - Attrition count and average work-life balance  
- Generate visualizations:
  - **Pie chart** – employee count by department  
  - **Bar chart** – marital status distribution  
- Interactive **dashboard** summarizing all key metrics
